    region: "Southern Rhone, France",
    info: "The Southern Rh√¥ne is situated in a large, sprawling valley, shaped by the course of the Rh√¥ne River. A Mediterranean climate makes the Southern Rh√¥ne Valley one of the warmest wine growing regions in France. Grape varieties that thrive in the region are well-suited to the hot, humid summers, and Grenache, Syrah, and Mourv√®dre are by far the most common plantings. The vast majority of Rh√¥ne wines found on the market are labeled as C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e). Many are excellent and inexpensive, making them one of the most consumer-friendly French wines to explore. Stylistically, they are rich, easy-drinking wines with moderate tannins and alcohol levels that fall between 14-15%. Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape is one of the better-known sub-regions of the Southern Rh√¥ne, and while the wines can be somewhat expensive, the quality is generally exceptional. Grenache is by far the predominant grape found in Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape blends, and lends jammy red and black fruit notes along with flavors of earth, leather and spice and dried herbs. The Southern Rh√¥ne also produces white wines, though in much smaller portion, typically these are made from Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier. Ros√© wines can be found as well and Tavel is famous for its vibrant, slightly spicy, salmon-hued ros√©s.",

    region: "France, Bordeaux",
    info: "Marked by its historic fortified village‚Äîperhaps the prettiest in all of Bordeaux, the St-√âmilion appellation, along with its neighboring village of Pomerol, are leaders in quality on the Right Bank of Bordeaux. These Merlot-dominant red wines (complemented by various amounts of Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon) remain some of the most admired and collected wines of the world. St-√âmilion has the longest history in wine production in Bordeaux‚Äîlonger than the Left Bank‚Äîdating back to an 8th century monk named Saint √âmilion who became a hermit in one of the many limestone caves scattered throughout the area. Today St-√âmilion is made up of hundreds of independent farmers dedicated to the same thing: growing Merlot and Cabernet Franc (and tiny amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon). While always roughly the same blend, the wines of St-√âmilion vary considerably depending on the soil upon which they are grown‚Äîand the soils do vary considerably throughout the region. The chateaux with the highest classification (Premier Grand Cru Class√©s) are on gravel-rich soils or steep, clay-limestone hillsides. There are only four given the highest rank, called Premier Grand Cru Class√©s A (Chateau Cheval Blanc, Ausone, Ang√©lus, Pavie) and 14 are Premier Grand Cru Class√©s B. Much of the rest of the vineyards in the appellation are on flatter land where the soils are a mix of gravel, sand and alluvial matter. Great wines from St-√âmilion will be deep in color, and might have characteristics of blackberry liqueur, black raspberry, licorice, chocolate, grilled meat, earth or truffles. They will be bold, layered and lush.",

    region: "Espa√±a, Rioja",
    info: "Rioja is arguably Spain's top wine region and is one of only two regions classified under the Denominaci√≥n de Origen Calificada (DOCa) system. Its two most important red grapes are Tempranillo and Garnacha. Although red wines from Rioja are prized, Spanish wines generally offer great bang for the buck, allowing one to indulge in quality vino without breaking the bank! There are four categories of red wine in Rioja. The youngest of these is ‚ÄúJoven‚Äù. ‚ÄúCrianza‚Äù wines are required to age for a minimum of 2 years, with 6 months spent in oak barrels. The next level is ‚ÄúReserva‚Äù in which the wine ages for a minimum of 3 years, with at least 1 year in oak barrels. Finally, the most mature wines are labeled ‚ÄúGran Reserva‚Äù. These wines mature for minimum 2 years in oak barrels, followed by at least 3 years in the bottle.Typically younger wines will be lighter in body style, exhibit more fresh fruit characteristics and are suitable to drink while young. Older wines have more developed flavor profiles, earthy characteristics, and are better suited to aging. The medium body and high acidity in Spanish red wines from Rioja makes them excellent for pairing with a variety of foods. The approachable price points makes these wines of outstanding quality, readily available to enjoy sans guilt.",

    region: "France, C√¥tes de Provence",
    info: "More than just a European vacation hotspot and Ros√© capital of the world, Provence, in southeastern France, is a coastal appellation producing interesting wines of all colors. The warm, breezy Mediterranean climate is ideal for grape growing and the diverse terrain and soil types allow for a variety of wine styles within the region. Adjacent to the Rh√¥ne Valley, Provence shares some characteristics with this northwestern neighbor‚Äînamely, the fierce mistral wind and the plentiful wild herbs (such as rosemary, lavender, juniper and thyme) often referred to as garrigue. The largest appellation here is C√¥tes de Provence, followed by Coteaux d‚ÄôAix-en-Provence. Provence is internationally acclaimed for dry, refreshing, pale-hued ros√© wines, which make up the vast majority of the region‚Äôs production. These are typically blends, often dominated by Mourv√®dre and supplemented by Grenache, Cinsault, Tibouren and other varieties. A small amount of full-bodied, herbal white wine is made here‚Äîparticularly from the Cassis appellation, of Clairette and Marsanne. Other white varieties used throughout Provence include Roussane, S√©millon, Vermentino (known locally as Rolle) and Ugni Blanc.Perhaps the most interesting wines of the region, however, are the red wines of Bandol. Predominantly Mourv√®dre, these are powerful, structured, and ageworthy wines with lush berry fruit and savory characteristics of earth and spice.",

    region: " Marlborough, New Zealand",
    info: "An icon and leading region of New Zealand's distinctive style of Sauvignon blanc, Marlborough has a unique terroir, making it ideal for high quality grape production (of many varieties). Despite some common generalizations, which could be fairly justified given that Marlborough is responsible for 90% of New Zealand's Sauvignon blanc production, the wines from this region are actually anything but homogenous. At the northern tip of New Zealand‚Äôs South Island, the vineyards of Marlborough benefit from well-draining, stony soils, a dry, sunny climate and wide temperature fluctuations between day and night, a phenomenon that supports a perfect balance between berry ripeness and acidity. The region‚Äôs king variety, Sauvignon blanc, is beloved for its pungent, aromatic character with notes of exotic tropical fruit, freshly cut grass and green bell pepper along with a refreshing streak of stony minerality. These wines are made in a wide range of styles, and winemakers take advantage of various clones, vineyard sites, fermentation styles, lees-stirring and aging regimens to differentiate their bottlings, one from one another. Also produced successfully here are fruit-forward Pinot noirs (especially where soils are clay-rich), elegant Riesling, Pinot gris and Gew√ºrztraminer.",

Tinto Fino is clearly the predominant wine in the assemblage of the varieties that make up this magnificent wine. The other variety used is Merlot, which is added to a greater or lesser extent depending on the vintage. Valbuena 5¬∫ 2015 is a concentrated and powerful vintage, but at the same time silky and deep. Few wines have a history as distinguished as that of Vega Sicilia. Founded in the 1860‚Äôs, its reputation on its flagship vintage has for more than 100 years produced two great wines, each appropriately named √önico. It was at Vega Sicilia in Ribera del Duero, two hours from Madrid, that Tempranillo proved its potential for greatness. When the estate's original founder, Don Eloy Lecanda Chaves returned from France with cuttings of Bordeaux varietals, he planted them alongside the indigenous variety, then known simply as Tinto del Pais, or ‚ÄúCountry Red‚Äù, but today known as Tinto Fino or Tempranillo. Surprisingly, it was the Tempranillo that produced the superior wine. Today, the market for Vega Sicilia is one of scarcity and increasing demand. Vega Sicilia‚Äôs growing fame and desirability is testament not only to the estate‚Äôs enduring legacy but to the world‚Äôs craving for wines of history and noble bearing. Vega Sicilia's vintage √önico, Reserva Especial and Valbuena are such wines.",

    price: 9000,
    region: "France, Bordeaux, Sauternes",
    info: "Chateau de Fargues can be enjoyed on the young side with no decanting. In fact, it is delicious and quite a treat young, even on release! However, like all great wines, Chateau de Fargues is much better with age and does not reach full maturity until it's between 12-35 years of age, or in some years, perhaps even longer in the best vintages! That is when the magic happens! But that is unrealistic for 99% of the world's wine drinkers. So, enjoy it on any special occasion that calls for it. Of course, the wine is sweet, but there is so much, incredible, racy acidity, the wine always feels fresh, and never cloying, which makes it quite fun to enjoy young. With Chateau de Fargues and frankly, all Sauternes, the temperature is more important than decanting. Chateau de Fargues is best served at 14 degrees Celsius, 57 degrees Fahrenheit. The cool, almost cellar temperature gives the wine more freshness and lift. The wine will naturally warm in the glass, while it develops more aromatic complexities and fleshes out. Chateau de Fargues can be served with seafood dishes, especially shellfish, lobster, crab, and oysters on the half shell. Foie gras is a perfect pairing with its natural sweet, salty and savory characteristics. Chateau de Fargues can also be paired with roasted chicken, veal, and pork dishes that are either spicy or prepared with a touch of sweetness. Spicy Asian cuisine, raw fish, like sushi or sashimi, and cheese, both hard and soft also make great pairings with Chateau de Fargues. Chateau de Fargues is a beautiful style of Sauternes. While it lacks the richness and ability to age that Chateau d'Yquem offers, it's a stellar example of Sauternes that many people find similar to a young vintage of Chateau d'Yquem, especially when tasted in its youth.",

    info: "In 1981, Marchese Lodovico Antinori breathed new life into Tenuta dell' Ornellaia, an estate whose potential had been ignored for decades. With the help of Andre Tchelistcheff, the famous agronomist, Antinori planted the first French vines in Bolgheri, which lies in the heart of Tuscany's coastal region, Maremma. The estate yields some of the finest Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc in Tuscany. In 2002, Marchesi de' Frescobaldi and Robert Mondavi became owners of Tenuta dell'Ornellaia, which is now owned exclusively by Marchesi de' Frescobaldi. Ornellaia has established itself among the iconic wine estates in Italy (and beyond). The estate is dedicated to producing charming and opulent wines, full of Mediterranean character and finesse, reflecting the estate‚Äôs unique terroir in Bolgheri on the Tuscan coast. The combination of Bolgheri‚Äôs unique soils and growing conditions, and what can only be characterized as a total obsession with excellence, result in the world-class wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Sauvignon Blanc that so many wine lovers across the world have come to cherish. Ornellaia employs a full time team of 80 people whose passion and motivation make Ornellaia what it is today. Wines are intently crafted to capture the character of each vintage, in all its complexity and facets. In fact, the character and intricacies of each individual vintage are so important to the estate that since vintage 2006, Winemaker and Estate Director Axel Heinz has identified a single word that captures the character of each vintage, and that word is interpreted by a contemporary artist who produces special labels and a site-specific work of art that remains part of the estate‚Äôs permanent collection.",

    region: "Valdobbiadene, Prosecco, Italy",
    info: " Vines have been grown in Conegliano Valdobbiadene since ancient times. In 1876 Conegliano became home to the first enology school in Italy, an institution of learning and innovation. It fundamentally altered the future course of winemaking in the region, and indeed the entire country, by perfecting the Italian Method of sparkling wine production in autoclaves to preserve and enhance the aromas of the indigenous grape varieties. A Consortium of Conegliano Valdobbiadene producers was formed in 1963 and was instrumental in obtaining the very first Prosecco appellation in 1969. In 2009, Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco was elevated to a DOCG, Italy‚Äôs highest wine category. Conegliano, home to the enology school and research center, is known as the area‚Äôs cultural capital, while Valdobbiadene, with its high altitudes, dramatically steep hillsides and twisting contours, is devoted mainly to production. While the vast majority (95%) of Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco is Spumante (sparkling or foamy), it is also made as a fizzy (Frizzante) wine, or even in a rare completely still version called Tranquillo. It comes in three different categories of residual sugar: ‚ÄúDRY,‚Äù with 17-32 grams of residual sugar per liter, is actually the sweetest; ‚ÄúExtra-Dry,‚Äù ranges from 12-17 grams; and Brut (0-12) is the driest category. Brut Nature or Zero Dossaggio Prosecco has less than 3 grams of residual sugar and Extra-Brut less than 6. Though most Prosecco is made in an autoclave, second fermentation in the bottle is still permitted under the DOCG guidelines, either in the traditional process known as Col Fondo (in which the sediment is left in the bottle) or Metodo Classico with sediment removed.",
